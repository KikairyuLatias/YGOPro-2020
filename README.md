# YGOPro-2020
Sakura's custom cards for ED0Pro

UPDATED: 4/7/2020

Welcome to my YGOPro Github.

Please be warned that the code here will probably only work on the new ED0Pro simulator released on April 5th, 2020 (and is subject to massive updates as things go on)

If you wish to still play on YGOPro 1.034, please go to the YGOPro4 folder. Trying to keep them separate to not confuse people.

# Disclaimer

I am fully aware that a lot of the cards here are one or more of the following on this list.

1. Lack of pictures or using filler ones thereof, though I am working on finding/creating non-filler ones. (Please do not confuse cards with similar arts in the meantime.)
2. Coding is broken somewhere or has not been updated. (There are some cards that I have not touched for a while.)
3. Code does not match up with the actual effects on card due to difficulties/issues with the core at this time. Remember, I am not a developer for the game, so I do not know what is going on.
4. Cards do not have coding at all, either due to my own inability to write the code or the YGOPro core at present does not support something of the sort. (Some cards exist in the .cdb, but are not codeable because of various issues)

Even with ED0Pro having an "updated" system, there are still things that need addressing. Also a note that this software uses OCG rulings instead of the TCG ones that these are ostensibly designed under.


# General stuff
- If anything is amiss (code is broken, pictures need fixing, etc), message me on Discord @Sakura#2014
- Do NOT change any of the code / CDB files on your own; otherwise, things will break. (However, if you would like to help, that would be greatly appreciated. Just submit a pull request or something to the file and I'll approve it.)
* Use the Sakura Card Database.cdb file for your files; it ªs less files than having all of the archetypes individually in their own CDBs. However, if you would prefer the multiple files, let me know.
